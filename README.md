# Flokken Vår

* The Flokken Vår project is made with the purpose of letting people get information, read and share stories about life and psychological health.
* In this early prototype the user can get information on psychologists, influencers and literature, view their own and others stories, and add and delete their own stories. Remark that a story can only be deleted if it is located in the respective user's local storage.
* Remark that the stories and other information are fictive for prototyping reasons
* Have a look at the prototype: https://flokken-b3631.web.app/
